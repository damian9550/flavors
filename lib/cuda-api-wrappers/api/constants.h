* is replaced at some point with the appropriate immediate value which goes into,
* the SASS instruction as a literal. This is apparently due to the theoretical
* possibility of different warp sizes in the future. However, it is useful -
* both for host-side && more importantly for device-side code - to have the
* warp size available at compile time. This allows all sorts of useful
* optimizations, as well as its use in constexpr code.
